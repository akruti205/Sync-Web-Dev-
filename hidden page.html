    <h1>CORE IDEA</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        Sync is a platform that exists to provide a space to synchronize students, conversations and resources in one
        fluid experience. <br>
        Sync is built on a simple belief: learning and collaboration should be effortless. <br><br>
        In a world where students juggle endless tabs, scattered resources, and chaotic group chats, Sync brings it all
        together: one platform, one flow. <br>
        Whether you’re deep in self-study, brainstorming for a competition, or sharing resources from your domain, Sync
        keeps you connected, focused, and in rhythm with your peers.
    </p>
    </p>

    <h1>GOALS</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>A single space for chatrooms, resources, and study tools.</li>
        <li>Eliminating friction between tools, resources and like-minded students</li>
        <li>Empower students to share knowledge across domains like finance, marketing, tech, and more</li>
        <li>Create a culture where students help each other succeed, beyond their own campus.</li>
        <li>Designing features that work just as well for a small group of friends as for a larger student community

        <h1>DESIGN RATIONALE</h1>
        <h2><b>Typography & Font Choices</b></h2>
        <h3>Our typography strategy emphasizes readability and modern appeal to resonate with Gen-Z users. We selected clean, sans-serif fonts that ensure optimal legibility across all devices and screen sizes. The font hierarchy creates clear information structure while maintaining the energetic, approachable vibe that appeals to our target demographic. Consistent font weights and sizes throughout the platform establish visual coherence and professional credibility.</h3>

        <h2><b>Color Palette & Visual Identity</b></h2>
        <h3>The vibrant color scheme combines dark backgrounds with bright accent colors to create a contemporary, engaging aesthetic that aligns with Gen-Z preferences for bold, high-contrast interfaces. The strategic use of red and pink gradients against dark backgrounds not only creates visual impact but also reduces eye strain during extended study sessions. This palette choice reflects the "Where Brains Meet Vibes" concept by balancing serious academic functionality with an energetic, social atmosphere.</h3>

        <h2><b>Layout & User Experience Design</b></h2>
        <h3>Our responsive design prioritizes intuitive navigation and seamless user flow. The layout employs modern web standards with flexible grid systems that adapt beautifully across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Strategic use of whitespace and component spacing creates breathing room that prevents cognitive overload while studying. The interface design follows contemporary UI/UX principles, incorporating familiar interaction patterns that reduce the learning curve for new users.</h3>

         <h1>CUSTOMER TESTIMONIAL</h1>
        <h3>Before, I had ten tabs open including Google Docs for notes, random group chats for discussions, a timer app for focus sessions, and messy bookmarks for resources. Now, it’s all in one place. <br>
            The domain-based chatrooms make it so easy to connect with people who actually get what I’m working on. Last week, I joined a random study session for my marketing case prep, and ended up meeting two students from different colleges who shared resources I never would’ve found on my own. <br>
            The Pomodoro timer keeps me on track, and I love that I can just share my own notes for others to use <br>
