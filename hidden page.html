    <h1>CORE IDEA</h1>
    <p id="intro">
        Sync is a platform that exists to provide a space to synchronize students, conversations and resources in one
        fluid experience. <br>
        Sync is built on a simple belief: learning and collaboration should be effortless. <br><br>
        In a world where students juggle endless tabs, scattered resources, and chaotic group chats, Sync brings it all
        together: one platform, one flow. <br>
        Whether youâ€™re deep in self-study, brainstorming for a competition, or sharing resources from your domain, Sync
        keeps you connected, focused, and in rhythm with your peers.
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h1>GOALS</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>A single space for chatrooms, resources, and study tools.</li>
        <li>Eliminating friction between tools, resources and like-minded students</li>
        <li>Empower students to share knowledge across domains like finance, marketing, tech, and more</li>
        <li>Create a culture where students help each other succeed, beyond their own campus.</li>
        <li>Designing features that work just as well for a small group of friends as for a larger student community
