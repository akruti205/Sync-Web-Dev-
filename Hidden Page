        <h1>CORE IDEA</h1>
        <h3>Sync is a platform that exists to provide a space to synchronize students, conversations and resources in one fluid experience. <br>
            Sync is built on a simple belief: learning and collaboration should be effortless. <br>
            In a world where students juggle endless tabs, scattered resources, and chaotic group chats, Sync brings it all together: one platform, one flow. <br>
            Whether you’re deep in self-study, brainstorming for a competition, or sharing resources from your domain, Sync keeps you connected, focused, and in rhythm with your peers.

        <h1>CUSTOMER TESTIMONIAL</h1>
        <h3>Before, I had ten tabs open including Google Docs for notes, random group chats for discussions, a timer app for focus sessions, and messy bookmarks for resources. Now, it’s all in one place. <br>
            The domain-based chatrooms make it so easy to connect with people who actually get what I’m working on. Last week, I joined a random study session for my marketing case prep, and ended up meeting two students from different colleges who shared resources I never would’ve found on my own. <br>
            The Pomodoro timer keeps me on track, and I love that I can just share my own notes for others to use <br>
